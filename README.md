## ✅ Core Features

- **Infection on Death**: Any speedrunner death permanently converts them to an infected hunter.
- **Snowballing Hunters**: The hunter team grows as deaths happen, making late game chaotic.
- **Win Conditions**:
  - Speedrunners win by killing the Ender Dragon.
  - Infected win when no speedrunners remain.
- **Compass Tracking**:
  - Infected hunters get a compass.
  - Right‑click cycles targets.
  - Sneak + right‑click opens a target picker GUI.
  - Uses last known locations when runners are in other dimensions.
  - Compass is anti‑drop and cannot be picked up by speedrunners.
- **Live Team Management**: Operators can move players between runner and infected directly from the GUI or command line during a match.
- **Disconnect-Safe State**: Leaving the server preserves your current team instead of corrupting the match state.
- **Minimal Visuals**: Standard Minecraft look with clean chat + title messaging.
- **Full GUI Control**: Everything in the config and commands is controllable via GUI.

## 🧟 How Infection Works

- At game start, one player is chosen as the infected hunter.
- All other players are speedrunners.
- Whenever a speedrunner dies, they permanently convert into infected hunters.
- Hunters always remain hunters even if they die again.
- Disconnecting does not change your team.
- The infected team wins when no speedrunners remain.

---

## 🧭 Compass Rules

- Hunters always receive a compass.
- The compass always tracks a speedrunner.
- Right‑click cycles targets.
- Sneak + right‑click opens the target picker.
- If a runner is in another dimension, the compass uses last‑known locations and tells you.
- Speedrunners cannot pick up hunter compasses or craft new ones during a match.
